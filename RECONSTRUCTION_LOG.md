# Reconstruction Log - Recreating Working Binance Delivery Connector

**Date:** July 24, 2025
**Issue:** Accidentally deleted working binance_delivery connector during git operations
**Goal:** Recreate EXACTLY the same working implementation that was documented in CLAUDE_SESSION_LOG.md

## Step-by-Step Reconstruction

### Step 1: Identify Missing Files
From my previous documentation, I had created these files but only 4 of 7 are currently present:

**✅ Currently Present:**
- `binance_delivery_constants.py` - API endpoints and rate limits
- `binance_delivery_auth.py` - API authentication
- `binance_delivery_utils.py` - Utility functions
- `__init__.py` - Package initialization

**❌ Missing (Need to Recreate):**
- `binance_delivery_derivative.py` - Main connector class ⭐ **CRITICAL**
- `binance_delivery_api_order_book_data_source.py` - Order book WebSocket handling
- `binance_delivery_user_stream_data_source.py` - User stream management
- `binance_delivery_web_utils.py` - Contract validation utilities

**Root Cause:** The current error shows `ModuleNotFoundError` for `binance_delivery_derivative` - this is the main connector class that the strategy needs.

### Step 2: Recreation Strategy
**Approach:** Copy from `binance_perpetual` connector and adapt for delivery futures API, exactly as I did before.

**Key Adaptations Needed:**
1. Change all imports from `binance_perpetual` to `binance_delivery`
2. Update API endpoints from `fapi` (futures API) to `dapi` (delivery API)
3. Update contract validation from `PERPETUAL` to `CURRENT_QUARTER`/`NEXT_QUARTER`
4. Update class names from `BinancePerpetual*` to `BinanceDelivery*`
5. Handle BTC-USD_251226 symbol format (delivery futures format)

Starting with the most critical file: `binance_delivery_derivative.py`

### Step 3: Update binance_delivery_derivative.py

**Action:** Copied from binance_perpetual_derivative.py and now adapting all imports and class names.

**Changes Made:**
1. **Import Updates:** ✅ Updated all binance_perpetual imports to binance_delivery
2. **Class Name Updates:** ✅ Changed BinancePerpetualDerivative → BinanceDeliveryDerivative
3. **Parameter Updates:** ✅ Changed binance_perpetual_api_key → binance_delivery_api_key
4. **Web Utils Updates:** ✅ Updated URLs from PERPETUAL_BASE_URL → DELIVERY_BASE_URL
5. **Contract Validation:** ✅ Updated from PERPETUAL → CURRENT_QUARTER/NEXT_QUARTER

### Step 4: Status Check
**✅ SUCCESS:** BinanceDeliveryDerivative now imports successfully!
