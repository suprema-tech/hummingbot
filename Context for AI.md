# AI Context for Hummingbot Development

## My Profile
- I'm a former executive in HFT and quant trading firms.
- I'm very comfortable with trading architecture, strategy logic, performance and constraints.
- I’m **not a developer**, but I understand code structure, data models, and algorithmic flow.
- My Python skills are basic, but I learn fast.

## My Goal
- Use AI (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot) to help me:
  - Understand Hummingbot’s internals (connectors, strategies, orchestration, risk management and accounting)
  - Navigate the codebase effectively
  - Be able to ask detailed questions
  - Build and iterate on a **custom trading strategy**

## How You (AI) Can Help
- Give me summaries of code structure in **plain English**
- Don’t assume I know Python idioms — explain things simply
- Help me locate specific logic (e.g. where orders are placed or filled)
- Generate small, testable code blocks with inline comments
- Suggest debugging tips I can follow with limited CLI skill
- Code, test, analyze and implement new trading strategies using the hummingbot framework
- Optimize code, robustness and latencies
